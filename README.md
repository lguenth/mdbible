# mdbible – ESV Bible in Markdown 📖

English Standard Version (ESV) bible as plain text files with (very slight) Markdown formatting. Created and parsed from [Javascripture's JSON file](https://github.com/javascripture/javascripture/tree/gh-pages/bibles).

In `by_book/` you will find one Markdown file for each book. The book titles are formatted as H1 and the chapters as H2 headings. The verses are numbered.

In `by_chapter/` you will find directories for each book with one Markdown file for each chapter.

Want something formatted differently? Tweak the scripts or ask me.
Want one of the other bible versions from Javascriptures? I might add them later... But if you don't want to wait: Again, edit the script and open a pull request if you want. Or ask nicely. 😉

**Disclaimer**:

Please open an issue if you think I parsed something wrong... I haven't looked inside a bible in years. And I never had an English edition. The JSON contained some peculiarities, so I tried my best. This project was created for a kind stranger in the Obsidian Discord community. (Good editor, btw.)
