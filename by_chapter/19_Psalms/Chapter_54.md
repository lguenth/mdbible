# Chapter 54

1. The Lord Upholds My Life To the choirmaster : with stringed instruments. A Maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and told Saul, Is not David hiding among us? O God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might.
2. O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
3. For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves.
4. Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.
5. He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them.
6. With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good.
7. For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
