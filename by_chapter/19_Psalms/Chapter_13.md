# Chapter 13

1. How Long, O Lord? To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
2. How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
3. Consider and answer me, O Lord my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
4. lest my enemy say, I have prevailed over him, lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.
5. But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
6. I will sing to the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me.
