# Chapter 120

1. Deliver Me, O Lord A Song of Ascents. In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me.
2. Deliver me, O Lord, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
3. What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue?
4. A warrior’s sharp arrows, with glowing coals of the broom tree!
5. Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
6. Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace.
7. I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war!
