# Chapter 3

1. Save Me, O My God A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. O Lord, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me;
2. many are saying of my soul, there is no salvation for him in God.
3. But you, O Lord, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head.
4. I cried aloud to the Lord, and he answered me from his holy hill.
5. I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the Lord sustained me.
6. I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.
7. Arise, O Lord! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked.
8. Salvation belongs to the Lord; your blessing be on your people!
