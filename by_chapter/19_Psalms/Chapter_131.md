# Chapter 131

1. I Have Calmed and Quieted My Soul A Song of Ascents. Of David. O Lord, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.
2. But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me.
3. O Israel, hope in the Lord from this time forth and forevermore.
