# Chapter 116

1. I Love the Lord I love the Lord, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy.
2. Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.
3. The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish.
4. Then I called on the name of the Lord : O Lord, I pray, deliver my soul!
5. Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; our God is merciful.
6. The Lord preserves the simple; when I was brought low, he saved me.
7. Return, O my soul, to your rest; for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.
8. For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling;
9. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.
10. I believed, even when I spoke : I am greatly afflicted;
11. I said in my alarm, All mankind are liars.
12. What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me?
13. I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord,
14. I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people.
15. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
16. O Lord, I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds.
17. I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the Lord.
18. I will pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people,
19. in the courts of the house of the Lord, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!
