# Chapter 15

1. Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
2. And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
3. The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.
4. Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mistreat me. But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
5. And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.
6. Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.
7. And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.
8. The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
9. And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
10. And they put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
11. But when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
12. all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
13. So Saul died for his breach of faith. He broke faith with the Lord in that he did not keep the command of the Lord, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance.
14. He did not seek guidance from the Lord. Therefore the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.

# Chapter 15

1. Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron and said, Behold, we are your bone and flesh.
2. In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the Lord your God said to you, You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.
3. So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel.
4. And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is, Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
5. The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You will not come in here. Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
6. David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
7. And David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.
8. And he built the city all around from the Millo in complete circuit, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
9. And David became greater and greater, for the Lord of hosts was with him.
10. Now these are the chiefs of David’s mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel.
11. This is an account of David’s mighty men : Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, was chief of the three. He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one time.
12. And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite.
13. He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines.
14. But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the Philistines. And the Lord saved them by a great victory.
15. Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
16. David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
17. And David said longingly, Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!
18. Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the Lord
19. and said, Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
20. Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against 300 men and killed them and won a name beside the three.
21. He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.
22. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two heroes of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
23. And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver’s beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
24. These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and won a name beside the three mighty men.
25. He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
26. The mighty men were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
27. Shammoth of Harod, Helez the Pelonite,

# Chapter 15

1. Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he could not move about freely because of Saul the son of Kish. And they were among the mighty men who helped him in war.
2. They were bowmen and could shoot arrows and sling stones with either the right or the left hand; they were Benjaminites, Saul’s kinsmen.
3. The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, both sons of Shemaah of Gibeah; also Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu of Anathoth,

10. Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth,
11. Attai sixth, Eliel seventh,
12. Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth,
13. Jeremiah tenth, Machbannai eleventh.
14. These Gadites were officers of the army; the least was a match for a hundred men and the greatest for a thousand.
15. These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
16. And some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
17. David went out to meet them and said to them, If you have come to me in friendship to help me, my heart will be joined to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong in my hands, then may the God of our fathers see and rebuke you.
18. Then the Spirit clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said, We are yours, O David, and with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers! For your God helps you. Then David received them and made them officers of his troops.
19. Some of the men of Manasseh deserted to David when he came with the Philistines for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, At peril to our heads he will desert to his master Saul. )
20. As he went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
21. They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and were commanders in the army.
22. For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like an army of God.
23. These are the numbers of the divisions of the armed troops who came to David in Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word of the Lord.
24. The men of Judah bearing shield and spear were 6,800 armed troops.
25. Of the Simeonites, mighty men of valor for war, 7,100.

39. And they were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had made preparation for them.
40. And also their relatives, from as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, came bringing food on donkeys and on camels and on mules and on oxen, abundant provisions of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, and wine and oil, oxen and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.

# Chapter 15

1. David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader.
2. And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seems good to you and from the Lord our God, let us send abroad to our brothers who remain in all the lands of Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites in the cities that have pasturelands, that they may be gathered to us.
3. Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul.
4. All the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
5. So David assembled all Israel from the Nile of Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
6. And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim that belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the Lord who sits enthroned above the cherubim.
7. And they carried the ark of God on a new cart, from the house of Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio were driving the cart.
8. And David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, with song and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets.
9. And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand to take hold of the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
10. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he put out his hand to the ark, and he died there before God.
11. And David was angry because the Lord had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
12. And David was afraid of God that day, and he said, How can I bring the ark of God home to me?
13. So David did not take the ark home into the city of David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
14. And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that he had.

# Chapter 15

1. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also masons and carpenters to build a house for him.
2. And David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
3. And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters.
4. These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem : Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
5. Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
6. Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
7. Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.
8. When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went out against them.
9. Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim.
10. And David inquired of God, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand? And the Lord said to him, Go up, and I will give them into your hand.
11. And he went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them down there. And David said, God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood. Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim.
12. And they left their gods there, and David gave command, and they were burned.
13. And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
14. And when David again inquired of God, God said to him, You shall not go up after them; go around and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
15. And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.
16. And David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
17. And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations.

# Chapter 15

1. David built houses for himself in the city of David. And he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
2. Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the Lord had chosen them to carry the ark of the Lord and to minister to him forever.
3. And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord to its place, which he had prepared for it.
4. And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites :
5. of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 of his brothers;
6. of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 of his brothers;
7. of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 of his brothers;
8. of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 of his brothers;
9. of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 of his brothers;
10. of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 of his brothers.
11. Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,
12. and said to them, You are the heads of the fathers ’ houses of the Levites. Consecrate yourselves, you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.
13. Because you did not carry it the first time, the Lord our God broke out against us, because we did not seek him according to the rule.
14. So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel.
15. And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord.
16. David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy.
17. So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
18. and with them their brothers of the second order, Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
19. The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals;
20. Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth;
21. but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith.
22. Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for he understood it.
23. Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
24. Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, should blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
25. So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.
26. And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
27. David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers. And David wore a linen ephod.
28. So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, to the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on harps and lyres.
29. And as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.
