# Chapter 45

1. The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah :
2. Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch :
3. You said, Woe is me! For the Lord has added sorrow to my pain. I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.
4. Thus shall you say to him, Thus says the Lord : Behold, what I have built I am breaking down, and what I have planted I am plucking up —that is, the whole land.
5. And do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not, for behold, I am bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the Lord. But I will give you your life as a prize of war in all places to which you may go.
