## Chapter 10

1. Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
2. And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
3. The battle pressed hard against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was wounded by the archers.
4. Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mistreat me. But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
5. And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.
6. Thus Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.
7. And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.
8. The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
9. And they stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.
10. And they put his armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
11. But when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
12. all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
13. So Saul died for his breach of faith. He broke faith with the Lord in that he did not keep the command of the Lord, and also consulted a medium, seeking guidance.
14. He did not seek guidance from the Lord. Therefore the Lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.

## Chapter 11

1. Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron and said, Behold, we are your bone and flesh.
2. In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the Lord your God said to you, You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.
3. So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by Samuel.
4. And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is, Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
5. The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You will not come in here. Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
6. David said, Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
7. And David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.
8. And he built the city all around from the Millo in complete circuit, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
9. And David became greater and greater, for the Lord of hosts was with him.
10. Now these are the chiefs of David’s mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel.
11. This is an account of David’s mighty men : Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, was chief of the three. He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one time.
12. And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite.
13. He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines.
14. But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the Philistines. And the Lord saved them by a great victory.
15. Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
16. David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
17. And David said longingly, Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!
18. Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the Lord
19. and said, Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
20. Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against 300 men and killed them and won a name beside the three.
21. He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.
22. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two heroes of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
23. And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver’s beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
24. These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and won a name beside the three mighty men.
25. He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
26. The mighty men were Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
27. Shammoth of Harod, Helez the Pelonite,

## Chapter 12

1. Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he could not move about freely because of Saul the son of Kish. And they were among the mighty men who helped him in war.
2. They were bowmen and could shoot arrows and sling stones with either the right or the left hand; they were Benjaminites, Saul’s kinsmen.

10. Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth,
11. Attai sixth, Eliel seventh,
12. Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth,
13. Jeremiah tenth, Machbannai eleventh.
14. These Gadites were officers of the army; the least was a match for a hundred men and the greatest for a thousand.
15. These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
16. And some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
17. David went out to meet them and said to them, If you have come to me in friendship to help me, my heart will be joined to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong in my hands, then may the God of our fathers see and rebuke you.
18. Then the Spirit clothed Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said, We are yours, O David, and with you, O son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers! For your God helps you. Then David received them and made them officers of his troops.
19. Some of the men of Manasseh deserted to David when he came with the Philistines for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, At peril to our heads he will desert to his master Saul. )
20. As he went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
21. They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and were commanders in the army.
22. For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like an army of God.
23. These are the numbers of the divisions of the armed troops who came to David in Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, according to the word of the Lord.
24. The men of Judah bearing shield and spear were 6,800 armed troops.
25. Of the Simeonites, mighty men of valor for war, 7,100.

39. And they were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had made preparation for them.
40. And also their relatives, from as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, came bringing food on donkeys and on camels and on mules and on oxen, abundant provisions of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, and wine and oil, oxen and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.

## Chapter 13

1. David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader.
2. And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seems good to you and from the Lord our God, let us send abroad to our brothers who remain in all the lands of Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites in the cities that have pasturelands, that they may be gathered to us.
3. Then let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it in the days of Saul.
4. All the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
5. So David assembled all Israel from the Nile of Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
6. And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim that belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the Lord who sits enthroned above the cherubim.
7. And they carried the ark of God on a new cart, from the house of Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio were driving the cart.
8. And David and all Israel were celebrating before God with all their might, with song and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets.
9. And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand to take hold of the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
10. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he put out his hand to the ark, and he died there before God.
11. And David was angry because the Lord had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
12. And David was afraid of God that day, and he said, How can I bring the ark of God home to me?
13. So David did not take the ark home into the city of David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
14. And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that he had.

## Chapter 14

1. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, also masons and carpenters to build a house for him.
2. And David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
3. And David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters.
4. These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem : Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
5. Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
6. Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
7. Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.
8. When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went out against them.
9. Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim.
10. And David inquired of God, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand? And the Lord said to him, Go up, and I will give them into your hand.
11. And he went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them down there. And David said, God has broken through my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood. Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim.
12. And they left their gods there, and David gave command, and they were burned.
13. And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.
14. And when David again inquired of God, God said to him, You shall not go up after them; go around and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
15. And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.
16. And David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
17. And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations.

## Chapter 15

1. David built houses for himself in the city of David. And he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
2. Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the Lord had chosen them to carry the ark of the Lord and to minister to him forever.
3. And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord to its place, which he had prepared for it.
4. And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites :
5. of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 of his brothers;
6. of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 of his brothers;
7. of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 of his brothers;
8. of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 of his brothers;
9. of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 of his brothers;
10. of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 of his brothers.
11. Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,
12. and said to them, You are the heads of the fathers ’ houses of the Levites. Consecrate yourselves, you and your brothers, so that you may bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.
13. Because you did not carry it the first time, the Lord our God broke out against us, because we did not seek him according to the rule.
14. So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel.
15. And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord.
16. David also commanded the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their brothers as the singers who should play loudly on musical instruments, on harps and lyres and cymbals, to raise sounds of joy.
17. So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari, their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
18. and with them their brothers of the second order, Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.
19. The singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were to sound bronze cymbals;
20. Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth;
21. but Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres according to the Sheminith.
22. Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for he understood it.
23. Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
24. Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, should blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were to be gatekeepers for the ark.
25. So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.
26. And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
27. David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers. And David wore a linen ephod.
28. So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, to the sound of the horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and made loud music on harps and lyres.
29. And as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised him in her heart.

## Chapter 16

1. And they brought in the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.
2. And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord
3. and distributed to all Israel, both men and women, to each a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.
4. Then he appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of the Lord, to invoke, to thank, and to praise the Lord, the God of Israel.
5. Asaph was the chief, and second to him were Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, who were to play harps and lyres; Asaph was to sound the cymbals,
6. and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
7. Then on that day David first appointed that thanksgiving be sung to the Lord by Asaph and his brothers.
8. Oh give thanks to the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples!
9. Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works!
10. Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice!
11. Seek the Lord and his strength; seek his presence continually!
12. Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles and the judgments he uttered,
13. O offspring of Israel his servant, children of Jacob, his chosen ones!
14. He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
15. Remember his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations,
16. the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,
17. which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
18. saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan, as your portion for an inheritance.
19. When you were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,
20. wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,
21. he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,
22. saying, Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!
23. Sing to the Lord, all the earth! Tell of his salvation from day to day.
24. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples!
25. For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, and he is to be feared above all gods.
26. For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
27. Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and joy are in his place.
28. Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength!
29. Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; bring an offering and come before him! Worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness;
30. tremble before him, all the earth; yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved.
31. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice, and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigns!
32. Let the sea roar, and all that fills it; let the field exult, and everything in it!
33. Then shall the trees of the forest sing for joy before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth.
34. Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever!
35. Say also: Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather and deliver us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
36. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Then all the people said, Amen! and praised the Lord.
37. So David left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord to minister regularly before the ark as each day required,
38. and also Obed-edom and his sixty-eight brothers, while Obed-edom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah were to be gatekeepers.
39. And he left Zadok the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon
40. to offer burnt offerings to the Lord on the altar of burnt offering regularly morning and evening, to do all that is written in the Law of the Lord that he commanded Israel.
41. With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and expressly named to give thanks to the Lord, for his steadfast love endures forever.
42. Heman and Jeduthun had trumpets and cymbals for the music and instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were appointed to the gate.
43. Then all the people departed each to his house, and David went home to bless his household.

## Chapter 17

1. Now when David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under a tent.
2. And Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.
3. But that same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan,
4. Go and tell my servant David, Thus says the Lord : It is not you who will build me a house to dwell in.
5. For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up Israel to this day, but I have gone from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling.
6. In all places where I have moved with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar?
7. Now, therefore, thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel,
8. and I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
9. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall waste them no more, as formerly,
10. from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the Lord will build you a house.
11. When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
12. He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.
13. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, as I took it from him who was before you,
14. but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.
15. In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.
16. Then King David went in and sat before the Lord and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?
17. And this was a small thing in your eyes, O God. You have also spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have shown me future generations, O Lord God!
18. And what more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant.
19. For your servant’s sake, O Lord, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.
20. There is none like you, O Lord, and there is no God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
21. And who is like your people Israel, the one nation on earth whom God went to redeem to be his people, making for yourself a name for great and awesome things, in driving out nations before your people whom you redeemed from Egypt?
22. And you made your people Israel to be your people forever, and you, O Lord, became their God.
23. And now, O Lord, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as you have spoken,
24. and your name will be established and magnified forever, saying, The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel’s God, and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
25. For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.
26. And now, O Lord, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.
27. Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you, for it is you, O Lord, who have blessed, and it is blessed forever.

## Chapter 18

1. After this David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines.
2. And he defeated Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.
3. David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah-Hamath, as he went to set up his monument at the river Euphrates.
4. And David took from him 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but left enough for 100 chariots.
5. And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 men of the Syrians.
6. Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went.
7. And David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
8. And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze. With it Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.
9. When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the whole army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah,
10. he sent his son Hadoram to King David, to ask about his health and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had often been at war with Tou. And he sent all sorts of articles of gold, of silver, and of bronze.
11. These also King David dedicated to the Lord, together with the silver and gold that he had carried off from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.
12. And Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, killed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
13. Then he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s servants. And the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went.
14. So David reigned over all Israel, and he administered justice and equity to all his people.
15. And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
16. and Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests; and Shavsha was secretary;
17. and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were the chief officials in the service of the king.

## Chapter 19

1. Now after this Nahash the king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his place.
2. And David said, I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt kindly with me. So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David’s servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun to console him.
3. But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?
4. So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away;
5. and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.
6. When the Ammonites saw that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah.
7. They hired 32,000 chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the Ammonites were mustered from their cities and came to battle.
8. When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of the mighty men.
9. And the Ammonites came out and drew up in battle array at the entrance of the city, and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
10. When Joab saw that the battle was set against him both in front and in the rear, he chose some of the best men of Israel and arrayed them against the Syrians.
11. The rest of his men he put in the charge of Abishai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites.
12. And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me, but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will help you.
13. Be strong, and let us use our strength for our people and for the cities of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to him.
14. So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle, and they fled before him.
15. And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab’s brother, and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
16. But when the Syrians saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.
17. And when it was told to David, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan and came to them and drew up his forces against them. And when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
18. And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David killed of the Syrians the men of 7,000 chariots and 40,000 foot soldiers, and put to death also Shophach the commander of their army.
19. And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Syrians were not willing to save the Ammonites anymore.

## Chapter 20

1. In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led out the army and ravaged the country of the Ammonites and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. And Joab struck down Rabbah and overthrew it.
2. And David took the crown of their king from his head. He found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone. And it was placed on David’s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.
3. And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes. And thus David did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
4. And after this there arose war with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the giants, and the Philistines were subdued.
5. And there was again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair struck down Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
6. And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the giants.
7. And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, struck him down.
8. These were descended from the giants in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.

## Chapter 21

1. Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel.
2. So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, Go, number Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number.
3. But Joab said, May the Lord add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord’s servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel?
4. But the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem.
5. And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah 470,000 who drew the sword.
6. But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king’s command was abhorrent to Joab.
7. But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel.
8. And David said to God, I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.
9. And the Lord spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,
10. Go and say to David, Thus says the Lord, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.
11. So Gad came to David and said to him, Thus says the Lord, Choose what you will:
12. either three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the Lord, pestilence on the land, with the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. Now decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me.
13. Then David said to Gad, I am in great distress. Let me fall into the hand of the Lord, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.
14. So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell.
15. And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the Lord saw, and he relented from the calamity. And he said to the angel who was working destruction, It is enough; now stay your hand. And the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
16. And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
17. And David said to God, Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Lord my God, be against me and against my father’s house. But do not let the plague be on your people.
18. Now the angel of the Lord had commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
19. So David went up at Gad’s word, which he had spoken in the name of the Lord.
20. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
21. As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground.
22. And David said to Ornan, Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the Lord — give it to me at its full price —that the plague may be averted from the people.
23. Then Ornan said to David, Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all.
24. But King David said to Ornan, No, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the Lord what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.
25. So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site.
26. And David built there an altar to the Lord and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the Lord, and the Lord answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.
27. Then the Lord commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
28. At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.
29. For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon,
30. but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord.

## Chapter 22

1. Then David said, Here shall be the house of the Lord God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel.
2. David commanded to gather together the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, and he set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God.
3. David also provided great quantities of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing,
4. and cedar timbers without number, for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David.
5. For David said, Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and glory throughout all lands. I will therefore make preparation for it. So David provided materials in great quantity before his death.
6. Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the Lord, the God of Israel.
7. David said to Solomon, My son, I had it in my heart to build a house to the name of the Lord my God.
8. But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, You have shed much blood and have waged great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed so much blood before me on the earth.
9. Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies. For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
10. He shall build a house for my name. He shall be my son, and I will be his father, and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever.
11. Now, my son, the Lord be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the Lord your God, as he has spoken concerning you.
12. Only, may the Lord grant you discretion and understanding, that when he gives you charge over Israel you may keep the law of the Lord your God.
13. Then you will prosper if you are careful to observe the statutes and the rules that the Lord commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Fear not; do not be dismayed.
14. With great pains I have provided for the house of the Lord 100,000 talents of gold, a million talents of silver, and bronze and iron beyond weighing, for there is so much of it; timber and stone, too, I have provided. To these you must add.
15. You have an abundance of workmen : stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and all kinds of craftsmen without number, skilled in working
16. gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Arise and work! The Lord be with you!
17. David also commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
18. Is not the Lord your God with you? And has he not given you peace on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the Lord and his people.
19. Now set your mind and heart to seek the Lord your God. Arise and build the sanctuary of the Lord God, so that the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God may be brought into a house built for the name of the Lord.

## Chapter 23

1. When David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
2. David assembled all the leaders of Israel and the priests and the Levites.
3. The Levites, thirty years old and upward, were numbered, and the total was 38,000 men.
4. Twenty-four thousand of these, David said, shall have charge of the work in the house of the Lord, 6,000 shall be officers and judges,
5. 4,000 gatekeepers, and 4,000 shall offer praises to the Lord with the instruments that I have made for praise.
6. And David organized them in divisions corresponding to the sons of Levi : Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
7. The sons of Gershon were Ladan and Shimei.
8. The sons of Ladan : Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
9. The sons of Shimei : Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers ’ houses of Ladan.
10. And the sons of Shimei : Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
11. Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, therefore they became counted as a single father’s house.
12. The sons of Kohath : Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
13. The sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to dedicate the most holy things, that he and his sons forever should make offerings before the Lord and minister to him and pronounce blessings in his name forever.
14. But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi.
15. The sons of Moses : Gershom and Eliezer.
16. The sons of Gershom : Shebuel the chief.
17. The sons of Eliezer : Rehabiah the chief. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
18. The sons of Izhar : Shelomith the chief.
19. The sons of Hebron : Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
20. The sons of Uzziel : Micah the chief and Isshiah the second.
21. The sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli : Eleazar and Kish.
22. Eleazar died having no sons, but only daughters; their kinsmen, the sons of Kish, married them.
23. The sons of Mushi : Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
24. These were the sons of Levi by their fathers ’ houses, the heads of fathers ’ houses as they were listed according to the number of the names of the individuals from twenty years old and upward who were to do the work for the service of the house of the Lord.
25. For David said, The Lord, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.
26. And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service.
27. For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years old and upward.
28. For their duty was to assist the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God.
29. Their duty was also to assist with the showbread, the flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baked offering, the offering mixed with oil, and all measures of quantity or size.
30. And they were to stand every morning, thanking and praising the Lord, and likewise at evening,
31. and whenever burnt offerings were offered to the Lord on Sabbaths, new moons, and feast days, according to the number required of them, regularly before the Lord.
32. Thus they were to keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary, and to attend the sons of Aaron, their brothers, for the service of the house of the Lord.

## Chapter 24

1. The divisions of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron : Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
2. But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar became the priests.
3. With the help of Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, David organized them according to the appointed duties in their service.
4. Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than among the sons of Ithamar, they organized them under sixteen heads of fathers ’ houses of the sons of Eleazar, and eight of the sons of Ithamar.
5. They divided them by lot, all alike, for there were sacred officers and officers of God among both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar.
6. And the scribe Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in the presence of the king and the princes and Zadok the priest and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and of the Levites, one father’s house being chosen for Eleazar and one chosen for Ithamar.
7. The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
8. the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
9. the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
10. the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
11. the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
12. the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
13. the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
14. the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
15. the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,

17. the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
18. the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
19. These had as their appointed duty in their service to come into the house of the Lord according to the procedure established for them by Aaron their father, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him.
20. And of the rest of the sons of Levi : of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
21. Of Rehabiah : of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.
22. Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
23. The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
24. The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.
25. The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
26. The sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Jaaziah : Beno.
27. The sons of Merari : of Jaaziah, Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
28. Of Mahli : Eleazar, who had no sons.
29. Of Kish, the sons of Kish : Jerahmeel.
30. The sons of Mushi : Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their fathers ’ houses.
31. These also, the head of each father’s house and his younger brother alike, cast lots, just as their brothers the sons of Aaron, in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of fathers ’ houses of the priests and of the Levites.

## Chapter 25

## Chapter 28

1. David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel, the officials of the tribes, the officers of the divisions that served the king, the commanders of thousands, the commanders of hundreds, the stewards of all the property and livestock of the king and his sons, together with the palace officials, the mighty men and all the seasoned warriors.
2. Then King David rose to his feet and said : Hear me, my brothers and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord and for the footstool of our God, and I made preparations for building.
3. But God said to me, You may not build a house for my name, for you are a man of war and have shed blood.
4. Yet the Lord God of Israel chose me from all my father’s house to be king over Israel forever. For he chose Judah as leader, and in the house of Judah my father’s house, and among my father’s sons he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel.
5. And of all my sons (for the Lord has given me many sons ) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.
6. He said to me, It is Solomon your son who shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
7. I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues strong in keeping my commandments and my rules, as he is today.
8. Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the Lord your God, that you may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever.
9. And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a whole heart and with a willing mind, for the Lord searches all hearts and understands every plan and thought. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.
10. Be careful now, for the Lord has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary; be strong and do it.
11. Then David gave Solomon his son the plan of the vestibule of the temple, and of its houses, its treasuries, its upper rooms, and its inner chambers, and of the room for the mercy seat;
12. and the plan of all that he had in mind for the courts of the house of the Lord, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries of the house of God, and the treasuries for dedicated gifts;
13. for the divisions of the priests and of the Levites, and all the work of the service in the house of the Lord; for all the vessels for the service in the house of the Lord,
14. the weight of gold for all golden vessels for each service, the weight of silver vessels for each service,
15. the weight of the golden lampstands and their lamps, the weight of gold for each lampstand and its lamps, the weight of silver for a lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand in the service,
16. the weight of gold for each table for the showbread, the silver for the silver tables,
17. and pure gold for the forks, the basins and the cups; for the golden bowls and the weight of each; for the silver bowls and the weight of each;
18. for the altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his plan for the golden chariot of the cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
19. All this he made clear to me in writing from the hand of the Lord, all the work to be done according to the plan.
20. Then David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and courageous and do it. Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed, for the Lord God, even my God, is with you. He will not leave you or forsake you, until all the work for the service of the house of the Lord is finished.
21. And behold the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every willing man who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command.

## Chapter 29

1. And David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the palace will not be for man but for the Lord God.
2. So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble.
3. Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God :
4. 3,000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house,
5. and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the Lord?
6. Then the leaders of fathers ’ houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king’s work.
7. They gave for the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents of iron.
8. And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord, in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.
9. Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the Lord. David the king also rejoiced greatly.
10. Therefore David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the assembly. And David said : Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.
11. Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are exalted as head above all.
12. Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.
13. And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.
14. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.
15. For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding.
16. O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.
17. I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.
18. O Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.
19. Grant to Solomon my son a whole heart that he may keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, performing all, and that he may build the palace for which I have made provision.
20. Then David said to all the assembly, Bless the Lord your God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord, the God of their fathers, and bowed their heads and paid homage to the Lord and to the king.
21. And they offered sacrifices to the Lord, and on the next day offered burnt offerings to the Lord, 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
22. And they ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed him as prince for the Lord, and Zadok as priest.
23. Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king in place of David his father. And he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
24. All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
25. And the Lord made Solomon very great in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
26. Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
27. The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
28. Then he died at a good age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place.
29. Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of Nathan the prophet, and in the Chronicles of Gad the seer,
30. with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances that came upon him and upon Israel and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.
